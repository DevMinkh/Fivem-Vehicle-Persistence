# Fivem-Vehicle-Persistence
A very very simple standalone Vehicle Persistence script that saves the vehicle and location you are in when you press the "L" key and when you reconnect to the server it will respawn you into that vehicle in that location, keeping the vehicles health, fuel, heading etc the same.
